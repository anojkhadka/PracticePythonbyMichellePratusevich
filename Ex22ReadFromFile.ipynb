    "This second part of the question is bit challenging as the file contains huge number of data in it. Simple observation of the data file shows that third word in each line of the data represents a category. And, there are large number of such categories and each varies in number. We are required to find out how many times each of such category appears in the file. To do this, I first separate the categroy item in the line(using string parsing) and loop through each line and match it again while also setting the counter as loop goes on. When the item/category is different note the number of counts for that item and record that category. I have done this by writing to a separate csv file as the item does not match. In this way as I loop through whole of the file, number of different category and its name will be recorded. Easier said than done. Below is the code.\n",
