    "Let’s continue building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).\n",

    "Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”. For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word. As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and display a different message if the player tries to guess that letter again. Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly! Don’t worry about choosing a word randomly or keeping track of the number of guesses the player has remaining - we will deal with those in a future exercise.\n",

    "Basic working principle of this code is that it will first pick a random word from the file. Then we create a list that will contain equal number of elements as the number of letters in the word that we pick. As right guess of letter in the word is made they will be filled in the corresponding position of the list. Any wrong guess will be discarded simply by displaying warning message. A separate list for rightly guessed letter will be made. We keep track of the number of letters remaining to be guessed correctly by subtracting the length of the \n",
    "list of rightly guessed letters from the list that contains actual number of letters from the word. while loop is initiated and will keep running until all the letters in the word is guessed correctly."
