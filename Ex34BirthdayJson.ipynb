    "This code does all the job asked in the question. The way this code is designed is that first I create a simple dictionary of names and birthdates. This will act as a base to sart with. I have written three simple functions inside head Birthday function. Ask_Birthday function will do the job of asking user on whose birthday s/he wants to know and return the birthday accordingly. Another function Add_Birthday will do the job of adding birthday by user in the file. 'Update_jsonfile' function will keep updating the json file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run this code one needs to upload the jsonfile or create one along with this code file. As this code \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
