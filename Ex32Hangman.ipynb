    "This exercise is Part 3 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Ex30 and Ex 31.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start your Python journey anywhere, but to finish this exercise you will have to have finish Ex30 and Ex 31 or use the solutions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user. In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "i) Don't let the user make more than 6 incorrect guesses, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Optional additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "i) When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.\n",
    "    \n",
    "ii) Rather than telling the user \"You have 4 incorrect guesses left\", display some picture art for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!\n",

    "To rund this code and check first one needs to http://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt download and save this file in the same directory where this code file is located. This code will do all the things asked to do in the question including the extras. Here I have used nested function to build the game and besides random module I have also used colorma module to get colored message output for the user. Though it makes code longer by few lines, output it gives with colored message helps to make game user friendly. As asked in the question, if user repeats the correct guess it just displays warning message and re-asks user to enter input again. If more than six wrong guess is made game will display message and ask if player want to paly the game again. Picture representation of hangman is done by using as many vertical bars as the number of wrong guesses made.   \n"
