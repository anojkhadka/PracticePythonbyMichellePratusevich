I have not done error handling for this code so user strictly need to input positive integers to get the correct result. \n",

    "One can also use a formula that generates Fibonacci numbers and code that formula as a function. It will make code bit shorter. Check the link below for formula. Here, I have manually coded the sequence using for loop. First two numbers have been separated as they both are same number 1. First two numbers both being one makes it difficult to include in for loop. I separated them from the loop so that the flow for the rest of the numbers will be easy. However, one could try it in different way. \n",
