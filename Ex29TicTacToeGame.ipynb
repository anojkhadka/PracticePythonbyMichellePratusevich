    "Checking whether a game board has a winner\n",

    "Handle a player move from user input\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.\n",

    "Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n",

    "You should keep track of who won - if there is a winner, show a congratulatory message on the screen.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "If there are no more moves left, don’t ask for the next player’s move!\n",

    "This code has been broken into several functions. First part is the 'row_col_input' function that will ask user to input row and column index. Second part is another function named 'fill_list' that will take input from the first part and check and fill the respective positions accordingly.Another function 'game_board_grid' will do the job of showing tic tac game board. 'Winner_check' function will look for the number of victory each player has scored at the end of each game. Players can choose to play game multiple times and the overal score of the game will be shown as well at the end.\n",

    "This program does following things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If wrong row column index is entered or player enters the index position that has already been filled, it        will ask the user to enter the right index position again displayed in red.\n",
    "2. Two players will enter their row column index turn by turn.\n",
    "3. After each player enters the mark, game status will be shown so that it becomes easier for players to see the \n",
    "   available empty positions and the status of the game.\n",
    "4. Once all the positions have been filled the game automatically stops.\n",
