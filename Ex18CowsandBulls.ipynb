    "Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.\n",

    "This game is a popular 'cows and bulls' game. Some use 'cows' and 'bulls' in reverse way. However, that does not change the essence of game. Idea about the game has been briefly explained above and one may google(like I did) if have never heard about this game and want to know more.\n",

    "In context to the code below, it will ask user to enter four unique digits as guess. Digits are not repeated in the number, so one needs to make guess of four different digits number. As stated in the question, each time information about the cows and bulls will be displayed and any wrong entry will be warned with a message. Once the player/user enters a correct guess the game will stop. I have also used '__main__' method and made use of functions. Number to be guessed will be generated with random module that will generate a four unique digits number. "
