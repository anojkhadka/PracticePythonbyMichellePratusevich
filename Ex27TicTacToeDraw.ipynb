    "This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous exercise we explored the idea of using a list of lists as a “data structure” to store information about a tic tac toe game. In a tic tac toe game, the “game server” needs to know where the Xs and Os are in the board, to know whether player 1 or player 2 (or whoever is X and O won).\n",
    "\n",
    "There has also been an exercise about drawing the actual tic tac toe gameboard using text characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next logical step is to deal with handling user input. When a player (say player 1, who is X) wants to place an X on the screen, they can’t just click on a terminal. So we are going to approximate this clicking simply by asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, our tic tac toe game is really a list of lists. The game starts out with an empty game board like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "game = [[0, 0, 0],<br>\n",
    "\t[0, 0, 0],<br>\n",
    "\t[0, 0, 0]]<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The computer asks Player 1 (X) what their move is (in the format row,col), and say they type 1,3. Then the game would print out\n",
    "\n",
    "game = [[0, 0, X],<br>\n",
    "\t[0, 0, 0],<br>\n",
    "\t[0, 0, 0]]<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "And ask Player 2 for their move, printing an O in that place.\n",

    "This code has been broken into three parts. First part is the function that will ask user to input row and column index. Second part is another function that will take input from the first part and check and fill the \n",
    "respective positions accordingly. Last or the third part will run the game and make two players play the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "This program does following things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If wrong row column index is entered or player enters the index position that has already been filled, it        will ask the user to enter the right index position again displayed in red.\n",
    "2. Two players will enter their row column index turn by turn.\n",
    "3. After each player enters the mark, game status will be shown so that it becomes easier for players to see the \n",
    "   available empty positions and the status of the game.\n",
    "4. Once all the positions have been filled the game automatically stops.\n",
