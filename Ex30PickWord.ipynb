Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments.

    "This is a simple function to pick a random word from a file containing list of words. There are 267750 words in the file. It can be easily counted by seeing the line number of the last line. Each word is contained in a single line. Simple technique I used is first read whole file and create a list of all those words. After this, pick word randomly from the list using random python module. \n",
