    "This code asks user to guess a number and will end and display the result of the game if user either chooses to 'exit' or makes a correct guess. Else, game will keep going. Random module from python has been called to generate a random integer. This random integer generated will not be visible to the player as there is no point in knowing the guess you are going to make. Correct guess will be decided based on the difference between the random integer generated and guess made by the user. If difference is 0, guess is correct. Far guess is displayed if this difference is greater than three and if less than three guess will be assumed to be very near one. \n",

If user enters anything other than integers between 1 to 9 included and 'exit' this code will return message and ask to enter input again. Python fucntion is introduced to print the play statistics message every time the game ends. "
