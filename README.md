# PracticePythonbyMichellePratusevich
This repository contains solutions for exercises from Michelle Pratusevich's website. All the code files uploaded were written in jupyter notebook. Some text in the file written as markup language may not show up while seeing the file here. However, code part will be completely visible. For complete view, I suggest to download the file and see it in platform that supports jupyter or interactive python.
